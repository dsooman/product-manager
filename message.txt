Hello to whoever is reviewing this.

Please find my solution to your requirement, which is a Spring Boot based microservice, using Java 11.

In terms of testing, fire it up and point Postman or something at it; I often use curl in command line.

I have written tests in Spock in Groovy to take a BDD type-ish approach.

I have switched this to use in-memory database but it was developed with mysql and will build and work
with that instead, the config has been left commented out in the application.properties file.

If this were an actual real world requirement, I would expect it to be one of several microservices.

Another, which we might call order-service or order-manager or something.
That would make HTTP request to this microservice and get the latest set of
product purchase requirements.

A good enhancement would be to specify the supplier for the Product.
Then the order service would group those using a stream and then send the orders for
stock to the appropriate suppliers, some might want an email, or a message to a queue, or an
http request, etc, etc.

Another service might have a front end that recorded customer purchases and send
updates to this service to keep track of stock levels.   It could have a front
end in react or something, maybe it runs on handheld tablets with bar code scanner on
them or something, who knows?

If you find any bugs / missing requirements / want me to show how I would change any of
this on another feature or bugfix branch, let me know.


Things that could / should have been added:

-Fuller test coverage.   I only wrote tests I needed during development / testing and
there should be more.   I like an 80% or so test coverage level.

-Examples of Curl commands to use the API, but I am guessing you will figure it out.

-Dockerfile and Jenkins pipeline files, I can supply what I reckon those would be if you want.

-I have left TODO comments in the code of things I am not happy with and would seek to improve.


if you have any questions or comments please email me at dsooman@hotmail.com
